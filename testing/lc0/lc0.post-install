* lc0 as provided by Alpine Linux does not provide any network file, which is
* required to have the engine to function. Download one of the recommended
* networks here[1] and put them in $XDG_DATA_HOME/lc0/networks (defaults to
* $HOME/.local/share), lc0 reads them from newest to oldest.
*
* It also uses OpenCL backend by default (except ppc64le which has no OpenCL),
* which means you need to install an OpenCL loader like 'intel-compute-runtime'
* or use the slower BLAS backend.
