# Since cyclone itself is written in Scheme it needs to be bootstraped.
# For this propose, upstream provides a dedicated cyclone-bootstrap
# repository which includes C files generated by a previous cyclone
# version. We package this as cyclone-init-bootstrap in a separate
# package and compile the original cyclone Scheme sources using it
# initially. From that point onward, we build cyclone using itself.
#
# This is achieved by having both cyclone-init-bootstrap and cyclone
# provide the virtual cyclone-bootstrap package. The latter must have
# the higher provider priority.
