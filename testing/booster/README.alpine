Booster is an initramfs tool which can be used as an alternative to
Alpine's default mkinitfs. The Alpine Booster package will automatically
generate /boot/booster-$flavor analog to the /boot/initramfs-$flavor
image generated by mkinitfs.

When using extlinux, a bootloader entry for the generated Booster
ramdisk image can be configured in /etc/update-extlinux.d/, e.g.:

	$ cat /etc/update-extlinux.d/booster
	LABEL booster
	  MENU LABEL Linux lts (booster)
	  LINUX vmlinuz-lts
	  INITRD booster-lts
	  APPEND root=/dev/sda3 rootfstype=ext4 quiet

Additionally, Booster may need additional configuration depending on
your setup. Refer to the booster manual page for more information. In
both cases, after modifying the corresponding configuration files the
package triggers (for booster and/or syslinux) need to be re-run, e.g.
via apk fix.

Presently, it is not possible to replace mkinitfs with booster entirely.
