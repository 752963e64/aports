    network: avoid segmentation fault in race where no button is pressed
    
    This can actually happen, since all the buttons hook up to the "toggled"
    signal.
    
    This might also fixed an "use non-initialized variable" warning for the
    "method" variable.
    
    Indeed, looking at the GTK4 code, I read the following when clicking
    a button in a radio group:
    
    - The button which was previously active gets de-activated, emitting its
    corresponding toggled signal.
    - The active property for the clicked button gets set.
    - The clicked button emits its toggled signal.
    
    Therefore, if the first toggle signal gets processed before the active
    property is set, there can be a race condition. We are seeing this downstream
